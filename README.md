# My resume made with HTML & CSS

Running live at https://static.sethpainter.com/resume

This is just my personal resume, I made it originally in May of 2019 and have been updating it ever sence, but I feel like it makes sense to have it on version control

To get it into an actual resume format, I use Chrome's Print to PDF function with the following settings

- Destination: Save as PDF
- Pages: 1
- Layout: Portrait
- Paper Size: Letter
- Margin: none
- Scale: 82
- Background Graphics: On

If you like this template, feel free to download it and use it yourself with your information instead.

If you'd like a custom resume like this, feel free to reach out to me, as I will do them on commission.
